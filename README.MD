These cute emojis are known as "Blob" are no longer used in the Noto fonts (since Android O, I heard)

However, the demand of these Blobs are still huge for not only Android users but also everyone else on the internet. Thanks to the skyrocketing growth of slack, now everyone can use this cute cute cuuuute emojis to have better/smoother/funnier/lovelier communicationn.
I resized some of them to fit in 128 x 128 px requirement. Some of them were duplicated and some of them just did not get picked by me so in case someone wants have more of them, they are in the "extra" folders.

Enjoy!
